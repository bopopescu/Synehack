Customer made a transaction with Make my trip, cancelled the Flight and did not get back the refund. Contacted customer care but hasn't got proper replies from the bank. Make my trip says they have refunded from their side and now it's the bank that should take care of this transaction. Bank needs to resolve this issue ASAP.
